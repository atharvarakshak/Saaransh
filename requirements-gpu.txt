# GPU-accelerated dependencies (install these if you have CUDA/GPU support)
# Uncomment the lines below if you want GPU acceleration:

# For GPU-accelerated FAISS (requires CUDA)
# faiss-gpu

# For GPU-accelerated vector databases
# pymilvus
# qdrant-client

# For GPU-accelerated sentence transformers (optional)
# torch
# transformers

# Additional GPU dependencies that might be needed
# cupy-cuda11x  # or cupy-cuda12x depending on your CUDA version
